At AirSnitch, we believe that air pollution is an emerging issue with significant impacts on both society and the economy. That’s why we built this platform. Here’s how we do it:

- Leveraging Big Data

We collect, process, and store air pollution information from a wide range of governmental and non-governmental organizations. Currently, we are integrated with more than five platforms, and we have ambitious plans for expanding further!

- Making Data Accessible to Everyone, Anywhere

We believe that this data should be open and widely accessible. To help spread this information, we’ve built a powerful and truly RESTful API for developers. If you find this interesting, don't hesitate—check out our documentation. Excited? Request your API key via this link.

- Building an Open-Source Organization

Last, but definitely not least, AirSnitch will always be an open-source organization driven by a community of passionate individuals.
