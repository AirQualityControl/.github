# AirSnitch üåç

**AirSnitch** is an open-source platform for public air monitoring. Our mission is to make the invisible visible by providing access to real-time air pollution data for everyone.

## Features

### üåê Real-Time Air Quality Data

AirSnitch collects, processes, and stores air pollution information from a wide range of governmental and non-governmental organizations. We are currently integrated with more than five platforms, and we have ambitious plans to expand even further!

### üì° Accessible API for Developers

We believe that air quality data should be open and widely accessible. To facilitate this, we‚Äôve built a powerful and truly RESTful API for developers. Whether you're building an app or conducting research, our API makes it easy to access real-time air pollution data.
